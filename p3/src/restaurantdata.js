            "Zuni Cafe serves standards like caesar salads, burgers, and roast chickens. But the burger is grilled over a wood fire, served on focaccia, and is so good it almost transcends being a burger. The chicken is perfectly roasted and the caesar salad is so right it should teach a salad-making course at Stanford. Like the food, Zuni’s space is simple - but the floor-to-ceiling windows and copper bar make it one of the most memorable places to eat in the city. It’s been open since 1979, and it’s still the place we send people new to SF first.",

            "State Bird Provisions is still one of the most exciting places to eat in San Francisco. It’s known as “the place with the carts” thanks to all the servers whizzing around the dining room passing out dim sum dishes like they were beads on a Mardi Gras float. Whether you’re eating tofu caprese or jerk octopus or cajun-style duck andouille, you can count on each of those dishes being phenomenal. Coming here isn’t dinner as much as it’s an event, and one that everyone should experience at least once in their life.",

            "Dinner at this Hayes Valley restaurant can get expensive, but it’s always worth it to feel like you’re on a trendy rooftop patio plucked straight out of Mexico City. And in a place like San Francisco, where it’s easy to find excellent Mexican food, Cala’s stands out. The mostly-seafood dishes are some of the best in the city. If you need convincing, try the Dungeness crab or avocado tostadas, or the rockfish a la talla which is butterflied and grilled, and topped with red chili on one side and parsley sauce on the other. And remember, dinner here is still cheaper than booking a flight south.",

            "There are plenty of places in SF to load up on great seafood, but very few that offer it with an amazing view. Located in the Ferry Building, Hog Island Oyster Bar overlooks the Bay, so you can take in the view and (maybe) get a micro-tan while you wait outside for a table. Once you do, order all the chowder, raw oysters, and everything else you could want from the ocean without having to dive for it yourself.",

            "Outerlands feels like a boat-themed beach house in the middle of the Outer Sunset (you can thank the planked walls for that). The food here - from the eggs baked inside of their phenomenal bread to the roasted cod with spicy tomato sauce - is fantastic and worth dropping in for even if you forgot to make a reservation. Add a few of of their great cocktails into the mix, and a trip to Outerlands can make a few hours feel like a week-long vacation.",
